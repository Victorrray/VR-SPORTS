# Sportsbook Filtering Fix

## Issue Fixed

Fixed an issue where the sportsbook filtering wasn't properly filtering out sportsbooks in player props mode. Even when specific sportsbooks were selected (e.g., Fliff and NoVig), bets from other sportsbooks (e.g., ESPN Bet) were still being displayed.

## Root Cause

The issue had two main causes:

1. **Inconsistent Filtering Logic**: The player props mode was using a mix of key matching and name matching for sportsbooks, which led to inconsistent filtering.

2. **Name Matching Issues**: The code was trying to match sportsbook names after converting them to lowercase and removing spaces, but this was unreliable.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Player Props Bookmaker Filtering

Modified the bookmaker filtering in OddsTable.js to use strict key matching only:

```javascript
// Before
hasMatchingBook = propData.allBooks.some(book => {
  const keyMatch = bookFilter.includes(book.bookmaker?.key);
  const nameMatch = bookFilter.includes(book.book?.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, ''));
  const isPrizePicks = book.bookmaker?.key === 'prizepicks' || book.book?.toLowerCase().includes('prizepicks');
  console.log(`ðŸŽ¯ Checking book: ${book.bookmaker?.key} vs filter:`, bookFilter, 'keyMatch:', keyMatch, 'nameMatch:', nameMatch, 'isPrizePicks:', isPrizePicks);
  return keyMatch || nameMatch;
});

// After
hasMatchingBook = propData.allBooks.some(book => {
  // Strict bookmaker key matching only
  const keyMatch = book.bookmaker?.key && bookFilter.includes(book.bookmaker.key);
  console.log(`ðŸŽ¯ Checking book: ${book.bookmaker?.key} vs filter:`, bookFilter, 'keyMatch:', keyMatch);
  return keyMatch; // Only use key matching, not name matching
});
```

### 2. Fixed Combined Books Filtering

Applied the same strict key matching to combined books:

```javascript
// Before
hasMatchingBook = allCombinedBooks.some(book => {
  const keyMatch = bookFilter.includes(book.bookmaker?.key);
  const nameMatch = bookFilter.includes(book.book?.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, ''));
  console.log(`ðŸŽ¯ Checking combined book: ${book.bookmaker?.key} vs filter:`, bookFilter, 'keyMatch:', keyMatch, 'nameMatch:', nameMatch);
  return keyMatch || nameMatch;
});

// After
hasMatchingBook = allCombinedBooks.some(book => {
  // Strict bookmaker key matching only
  const keyMatch = book.bookmaker?.key && bookFilter.includes(book.bookmaker.key);
  console.log(`ðŸŽ¯ Checking combined book: ${book.bookmaker?.key} vs filter:`, bookFilter, 'keyMatch:', keyMatch);
  return keyMatch; // Only use key matching, not name matching
});
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging

Added more detailed logging to help diagnose filtering issues:

```javascript
// Enhanced logging for bookmaker filtering
console.log(`ðŸŽ¯ Bookmaker ${o.bookmaker.key} for market ${mktKey}: ${isIncluded ? 'INCLUDED' : 'FILTERED OUT'}`);
```

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Filtering**: Sportsbook filtering now works correctly, showing only the selected sportsbooks.

2. **Consistent Behavior**: The filtering logic is now consistent across all parts of the application.

3. **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging makes it easier to diagnose filtering issues.

## Technical Details

The key insight was that we should only use the bookmaker's key for filtering, not the display name. The bookmaker key is a unique identifier that is consistent across the application, while the display name can vary.

By using strict key matching, we ensure that the filtering is accurate and consistent.
