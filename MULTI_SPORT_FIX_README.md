# Multi-Sport Selection Fix

## Problem Fixed

We identified and fixed an issue where the VR-Odds platform was only showing games from a single sport, even when multiple sports were selected.

## Issue Details

In the SportsbookMarkets.js file, there was a limitation in the code that was preventing multiple sports from being used in the API call:

```javascript
// Original code (line 252)
const sportsForMode = isPlayerPropsMode ? ["americanfootball_nfl"] : (picked.length > 0 ? [picked[0]] : picked);
```

This code had two limitations:
1. For player props mode, it hardcoded to NFL regardless of user selection
2. For regular mode, it only used the first selected sport (`[picked[0]]`)

This is why you were only seeing NCAA games even though you had selected MLB, NCAA, and NFL.

## Solution Implemented

We've updated the code to use all selected sports:

```javascript
// New code
const sportsForMode = isPlayerPropsMode 
  ? (picked.length > 0 ? picked : ["americanfootball_nfl"]) 
  : picked;
```

The new code:
1. For player props mode, it uses the user's selected sports, or defaults to NFL if none selected
2. For regular mode, it uses all selected sports

## Benefits

- You can now see odds for multiple sports at once
- Player props mode will respect your sport selection
- The UI will show a more comprehensive view of available betting opportunities

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Select multiple sports (e.g., MLB, NCAA, NFL)
2. You should now see games from all selected sports
3. Try switching between regular mode and player props mode to ensure both work correctly

## Performance Considerations

If you experience any performance issues when selecting many sports at once, consider:
- Selecting fewer sports at a time
- Using the date filter to narrow down the results
- Refreshing the page if the data seems stale

## Additional Notes

This fix complements the EV filtering fix we discussed earlier. Now you can:
- Select multiple sports to see a wider range of betting opportunities
- Filter EV calculations based on your selected sportsbooks
- Get a more personalized and comprehensive betting experience
