## Sports-Specific Game Limits for Player Props

### üéØ Why Limits Are Needed

Player props require **individual API calls per game**. Without limits:
- **MLB:** 50+ games √ó 15 seconds = 12+ minutes (timeout!)
- **NBA:** 30+ games √ó 15 seconds = 7+ minutes (timeout!)
- **Cost:** 100 games √ó $0.001 = $0.10 per request

With Supabase caching, we can be smart about limits.

### üìä Current Sport Limits

| Sport | Game Limit | Reason | Typical Games |
|-------|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **NFL** | 100 | Small season (17 games), can handle all | 10-16 |
| **NCAAF** | 50 | Many games, but manageable | 30-50 |
| **NCAAB** | 50 | Many games, but manageable | 50-100 |
| **MLB** | 30 | 162-game season, too many to fetch all | 50-80 |
| **NBA** | 30 | 82-game season, too many to fetch all | 20-40 |
| **NHL** | 30 | 82-game season, too many to fetch all | 20-40 |
| **Soccer (EPL)** | 20 | Multiple games per day | 10-20 |
| **Default** | 40 | Safe default for other sports | Varies |

### ‚è±Ô∏è Timeout Protection

- **Per-Game Timeout:** 15 seconds per game
- **Total Request Timeout:** 2 minutes (120 seconds) total
- Returns partial results if timeout reached

### üîÑ How Caching Helps

- **First Request (Cache Miss):** Fetches and caches data (slower)
- **Subsequent Requests (Cache Hit):** Returns cached data (instant)
- **Cache Duration:** 5 minutes

## üìà Performance by Sport

| Sport | First Request | Cached Request | Games Shown | Players Shown |
|-------|---------------|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| NFL | 15-25 min | 2-3 sec | ALL (10-16) | 500-800 |
| NCAAF | 12-15 min | 2-3 sec | 50 | 1000-1500 |
| MLB | 7-8 min | 2-3 sec | 30 | 600-900 |
| NBA | 7-8 min | 2-3 sec | 30 | 600-900 |
| NHL | 7-8 min | 2-3 sec | 30 | 600-900 |
