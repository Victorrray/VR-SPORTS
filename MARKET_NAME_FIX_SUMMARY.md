## Changes Made

### File: `/client/src/components/betting/OddsTable.js`

#### Change 1: Enhanced `formatMarket` Function (Lines 303-381)
Added comprehensive market name formatting for all period-based markets:

```javascript
function formatMarket(key="") {
  const k = String(key).toLowerCase();
  
  // Quarter/Half/Period markets
  if (k === "h2h_q1") return "1st Quarter Moneyline";
  if (k === "h2h_q2") return "2nd Quarter Moneyline";
  if (k === "h2h_q3") return "3rd Quarter Moneyline";
  if (k === "h2h_q4") return "4th Quarter Moneyline";
  if (k === "h2h_h1") return "1st Half Moneyline";
  if (k === "h2h_h2") return "2nd Half Moneyline";
  if (k === "h2h_p1") return "1st Period Moneyline";
  if (k === "h2h_p2") return "2nd Period Moneyline";
  if (k === "h2h_p3") return "3rd Period Moneyline";
  
  // 3-way markets
  if (k === "h2h_3_way") return "3-Way Moneyline";
  if (k === "h2h_3_way_q1") return "1st Quarter 3-Way";
  // ... (and many more)
  
  // Base markets
  if (k === "h2h") return "MONEYLINE";
  if (k.includes("spread")) return "SPREAD";
  if (k.includes("total")) return "TOTAL";
  // ...
}
```

#### Change 2: Fixed Mini-Table Display (Line 2847)
Updated the mini-table market name display to use the `formatMarket` function as a fallback:

```javascript
// Before:
{row.mkt.name}

// After:
{row.mkt.name || formatMarket(row.mkt?.key)}
```
