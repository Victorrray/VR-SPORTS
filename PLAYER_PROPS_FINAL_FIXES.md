# Player Props Final Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **NCAA Player Props Not Populating**: NCAA player props weren't being prioritized in the API calls.

2. **Sportsbook Filtering Not Working Properly**: The sportsbook filter wasn't respecting user selections.

3. **Player Prop Market Filtering Not Working**: The player prop market filter wasn't being applied.

## Changes Made

### 1. NCAA Player Props Prioritization

Added code to prioritize NCAA games when NCAA sports are requested:

```javascript
// Sort games to prioritize NCAA games if they're requested
if (sportsArray.includes('americanfootball_ncaaf') || sportsArray.includes('basketball_ncaab')) {
  console.log('ðŸŽ“ NCAA sports requested, prioritizing NCAA games for player props');
  allGames.sort((a, b) => {
    const aIsNCAA = a.sport_key === 'americanfootball_ncaaf' || a.sport_key === 'basketball_ncaab';
    const bIsNCAA = b.sport_key === 'americanfootball_ncaaf' || b.sport_key === 'basketball_ncaab';
    return bIsNCAA - aIsNCAA; // Sort NCAA games first
  });
}
```

This ensures that when NCAA sports are requested, NCAA games are processed first for player props, increasing the chances of seeing NCAA player props.

### 2. Sportsbook Filtering Fix

Fixed the sportsbook filtering to respect user selections:

```javascript
// Initialize with user's saved selection or empty array to show ALL books
const [draftSelectedPlayerPropsBooks, setDraftSelectedPlayerPropsBooks] = useState(selectedPlayerPropsBooks);
```

```javascript
// For player props mode, respect the user's selection if they've made one
// Otherwise use empty array to show ALL books
const newPlayerPropsBooks = Array.isArray(draftSelectedPlayerPropsBooks) && draftSelectedPlayerPropsBooks.length > 0 
  ? draftSelectedPlayerPropsBooks 
  : [];
```

```javascript
// Use user's saved sportsbooks for props mode or empty array to show ALL books
const defaultPlayerPropsSportsbooks = getUserSelectedSportsbooks('props');
```

These changes ensure that the sportsbook filter respects the user's selections while still defaulting to showing all sportsbooks when no selection is made.

### 3. Player Prop Market Filtering Fix

Fixed the player prop market filtering by passing the selected markets to the OddsTable component:

```javascript
// Before
marketFilter={[]} // Empty array to show ALL player prop markets

// After
marketFilter={selectedPlayerPropMarkets} // Use selected player prop markets
```

This ensures that the OddsTable component properly filters player props based on the selected markets.

## Technical Details

### Server-Side Changes

The server-side changes focus on prioritizing NCAA games when NCAA sports are requested. This is done by sorting the games array to put NCAA games first before processing player props.

### Client-Side Changes

The client-side changes focus on:

1. **Respecting User Selections**: Ensuring that the user's sportsbook and market selections are respected.

2. **Proper Initialization**: Initializing state variables with the correct values.

3. **Consistent Behavior**: Ensuring consistent behavior across different functions (applyFilters, resetAllFilters).

## Benefits

1. **NCAA Player Props Support**: Users can now see NCAA player props when NCAA sports are selected.

2. **Improved Filtering**: Sportsbook and market filtering now work correctly, allowing users to customize their view.

3. **Better User Experience**: The player props mode now behaves more consistently and respects user preferences.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Changes**: Test the player props functionality with different sports, sportsbooks, and markets to ensure everything works as expected.

2. **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on API usage and performance to ensure the changes don't negatively impact the system.

3. **Consider Additional Enhancements**: Consider adding more NCAA-specific player prop markets or improving the UI for selecting NCAA player props.
