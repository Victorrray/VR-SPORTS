# 
The Odds API covers the betting markets listed below.

# 
These are the most common markets that are featured by bookmakers. Terminology for betting markets can vary by country, sport and even amongst bookmakers. We aim to simplify this by defining the following markets
spreads and totals markets are mainly available for US sports and bookmakers at this time.

```
spreads
```


```
totals
```

For descriptions of these markets, see [examples of betting markets](https://the-odds-api.com/sports-odds-data/betting-markets-examples.html).

# 
Starting in 2023, more markets are becoming available in the API. Additional markets are currently limited to US sports and selected bookmakers, however coverage is expanding. Additional markets update at 1 minute intervals.
Due to the growing size of the API response, additional markets need to be accessed one event at a time using the new [/events/{eventId}/odds endpoint](https://the-odds-api.com/liveapi/guides/v4/).

```
/events/{eventId}/odds
```
