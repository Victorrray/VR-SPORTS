The structure around line 1120 seems to be:

1. outcome.forEach (line 1119)
2. market.outcomes.forEach (line 1120)
3. bookmaker.markets.forEach (line 1121)
4. game.bookmakers.forEach (line 1122)
5. games.forEach (line 1123)

The closing braces are:
1. if (game.bookmakers) { (line 1123)
2. if (games && games.length > 0) { (line 1124)
3. try { (line 1125)

But we've removed the try block, so we need to adjust the structure.
