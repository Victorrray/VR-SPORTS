# Player Props Testing Guide

## Quick Reference: Sportsbook Coverage & Alternate Markets

### What Was Added

#### 1. Comprehensive Sportsbook Logging
- Server now logs all sportsbooks being pulled for player props
- Distinguishes between US sportsbooks and DFS apps
- Shows market counts per bookmaker
- Tracks which books are filtered/skipped

#### 2. New Basketball Alternate Markets (15 total)
**Individual Alternates:**
- player_points_alternate
- player_rebounds_alternate
- player_assists_alternate
- player_blocks_alternate
- player_steals_alternate
- player_turnovers_alternate
- player_threes_alternate

**Combination Alternates:**
- player_points_assists_alternate
- player_points_rebounds_alternate
- player_rebounds_assists_alternate
- player_points_rebounds_assists_alternate

## Testing Steps

### 1. Verify Sportsbook Coverage

**In Browser:**
```
1. Go to Sportsbooks page
2. Click "Player Props" tab
3. Select "NBA" sport
4. Select "Today" or specific date
5. Open browser DevTools (F12)
6. Go to Console tab
```

**In Server Logs:**
```
Look for messages like:
ðŸ“Š SPORTSBOOK COVERAGE FOR PLAYER PROPS (Game: abc123)
ðŸ“Š Total bookmakers in response: 12
ðŸ“Š US Sportsbooks: 10 - draftkings, fanduel, betmgm, caesars, pointsbet, betrivers...
ðŸ“Š DFS Apps: 2 - prizepicks, underdog
```

### 2. Verify Alternate Markets Load

**In Browser:**
```
1. Select NBA player props
2. Click on Player Prop Markets filter
3. Scroll down to see all available markets
4. Look for "Alternate" markets:
   - Alternate Points (Over/Under)
   - Alternate Rebounds (Over/Under)
   - Alternate Assists (Over/Under)
   - etc.
5. Select one and apply filter
6. Verify data loads
```

### 3. Check Sportsbook Filtering

**Expected Behavior:**
- All US sportsbooks should appear in the sportsbook filter
- All DFS apps should appear in the sportsbook filter
- When you select a sportsbook, only that book's lines appear
- When you select multiple books, all their lines appear

**If Books Are Missing:**
1. Check server logs for "Skipping {bookmaker}" messages
2. Verify user plan allows access to that book
3. Check if book is in `allowedBookmakers` list
4. Verify TheOddsAPI account has access

## Debugging Commands

### Check if Alternate Markets Are in Response
```javascript
// In browser console
// After loading player props, check the games data
console.log(window.__gamesData?.bookmakers?.map(b => b.markets?.map(m => m.key)));
```

### Monitor Sportsbook Filtering
```javascript
// Check which books are being filtered
console.log('Effective selected books:', window.__effectiveSelectedBooks);
console.log('Book filter:', window.__bookFilter);
```

### Check Market Selection
```javascript
// Verify selected markets
console.log('Selected markets:', window.__selectedPlayerPropMarkets);
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Only 2-3 Sportsbooks Appearing
**Possible Causes:**
1. Date filter showing only games with limited coverage
2. User plan doesn't include all books
3. TheOddsAPI not returning all bookmakers

**Solution:**
- Check server logs for sportsbook coverage
- Verify user plan in database
- Try different date or "All Dates" filter

### Issue: Alternate Markets Not Showing
**Possible Causes:**
1. Markets not in PLAYER_PROP_MARKETS array
2. Sport not set to basketball
3. Markets not requested from API

**Solution:**
- Verify markets are in SportsbookMarkets.js lines 105-126
- Ensure basketball is selected
- Check server logs for market requests

### Issue: DFS Apps Not Appearing
**Possible Causes:**
1. `regions=us_dfs` not in API call
2. DFS apps filtered out by plan restrictions
3. No DFS app data available for that date

**Solution:**
- Verify server uses `regions=us,us_dfs`
- Check user plan includes DFS apps
- Try different date with more games
