## 4Ô∏è‚É£ GitHub Actions CI/CD

### Check Workflow Status

1. Go to: `https://github.com/Victorrray/VR-SPORTS/actions`
2. Look for the "Tests & Quality Checks" workflow
3. Check the latest run

### Trigger a Test Run

```bash
# Make a test commit
git commit --allow-empty -m "test: trigger CI/CD pipeline"
git push
```

### Expected Workflow Jobs

- ‚úÖ Lint & Format (5 min)
- ‚úÖ Backend Unit Tests (10 min)
- ‚úÖ Frontend Unit Tests (10 min)
- ‚úÖ E2E Tests (15 min)
- ‚úÖ Build Verification (10 min)
- ‚úÖ Security Checks (5 min)
- ‚úÖ Test Summary (2 min)

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- [ ] All jobs pass
- [ ] No failed tests
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Security checks pass
- [ ] Artifacts uploaded
- [ ] PR comments appear (if PR)

### View Logs

Click on each job to see detailed logs:
- Lint output
- Test results
- Build logs
- Security scan results

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Sentry Error Tracking

### Setup Required First

```bash
# Add to .env
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
```

### Test Error Capture

1. Create a test error endpoint:
```javascript
app.get('/test-error', (req, res) => {
  throw new Error('Test error for Sentry');
});
```

2. Trigger it:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/test-error
```

3. Check Sentry dashboard:
   - Go to https://sentry.io
   - View your project
   - Should see the error appear

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- [ ] Sentry DSN configured
- [ ] Error appears in Sentry dashboard
- [ ] Stack trace is captured
- [ ] Request context included
- [ ] User ID tracked (if available)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Health Endpoints Return 503

**Issue**: Status is "degraded"
**Solution**: Check database/cache/API connectivity

```bash
# Test database connection
curl http://localhost:3001/health
# Check "checks" object for failures
```

### No Log Files Created

**Issue**: `logs/` directory missing
**Solution**: Create it manually

```bash
mkdir -p logs
npm start
```

### Jest Tests Fail

**Issue**: Tests not running
**Solution**: Install dependencies

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest --legacy-peer-deps
npm test
```

### GitHub Actions Not Running

**Issue**: Workflow not triggered
**Solution**: Check branch name

```bash
# Must be on main or develop
git branch
git push origin main
```

### Sentry Not Capturing Errors

**Issue**: Errors not appearing in Sentry
**Solution**: Verify DSN is correct

```bash
# Check .env
cat .env | grep SENTRY_DSN

# Restart server
npm start
```
