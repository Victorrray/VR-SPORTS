## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No "Cached" Badge

**Debug Steps:**
1. Open browser console
2. Look for: `console.log('Using cache:', usingCache)`
3. Should be `true` for NFL only

**Common Causes:**
- Multiple sports selected (cache only works for single NFL)
- Backend not running
- Migration not executed

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check backend is running
curl http://localhost:10000/api/cached-odds/stats

# Should return update statistics
```

---

### Issue: Slow Loading

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check Network tab response time
2. Should be <100ms for cached data

**Common Causes:**
- Cache not populated
- Backend service not running

**Fix:**
```bash
# Manually trigger update
curl -X POST http://localhost:10000/api/cached-odds/nfl/update \
  -H "x-admin-key: your_admin_key"

# Check cache has data
curl http://localhost:10000/api/cached-odds/nfl | jq 'length'
```

---

### Issue: Stale Data

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check last_update timestamp in data
2. Should be within last 2 minutes

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check update frequency
curl http://localhost:10000/api/cached-odds/stats | jq '.stats[0]'

# Should show recent updates every 60 seconds
```

---

## 📊 Performance Validation

### Measure Load Time

**Chrome DevTools:**
1. Open Performance tab
2. Start recording
3. Select NFL
4. Stop recording
5. Check "Load" time

**Expected:**
- Cached: <100ms
- API: 2-5 seconds

### Measure API Calls

**Network Tab:**
1. Clear network log
2. Select NFL
3. Count requests

**Expected:**
- Cached: 1 request to `/api/cached-odds/nfl`
- API: 1 request to `/api/odds`
