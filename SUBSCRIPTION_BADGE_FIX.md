# Subscription Badge Fix

## Problem Fixed

We identified and fixed an inconsistency in the subscription badge display. The user has a Gold Plan subscription, but the badge at the top of the page was incorrectly showing "PLATINUM" instead of "GOLD".

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Status Badge Logic in Account.js**:
   ```javascript
   <div className={`status-badge ${me?.plan === 'platinum' ? 'platinum' : me?.plan === 'gold' ? 'gold' : 'free-trial'}`}>
     {me?.plan === 'platinum' ? (
       <>
         <Crown size={12} />
         <span>Platinum</span>
       </>
     ) : me?.plan === 'gold' ? (
       <>
         <Crown size={12} />
         <span>Gold</span>
       </>
     ) : (
       <>
         <Zap size={12} />
         <span>Free Trial</span>
       </>
     )}
   </div>
   ```

2. **Added Gold Badge CSS Styling**:
   ```css
   .status-badge.gold {
     background: rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.12);
     color: #FFD700;
     border: 1px solid rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.25);
   }
   ```

## Result

Now the subscription badge correctly shows "GOLD" instead of "PLATINUM" when the user has a Gold Plan subscription. This ensures consistency between:

1. The badge in the user profile section
2. The plan display in the subscription section
3. The actual subscription status in the database

Both badges now use the same styling and iconography (Crown icon) but with slightly different shading to maintain the visual hierarchy between Gold and Platinum plans.

## Visual Appearance

- **Gold Badge**: Gold crown icon with "GOLD" text
- **Platinum Badge**: Gold crown icon with "PLATINUM" text (slightly brighter gold color)
- **Free Trial Badge**: Purple lightning bolt icon with "FREE TRIAL" text

This change ensures a consistent user experience and accurately reflects the user's current subscription status throughout the interface.
