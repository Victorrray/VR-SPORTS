    userId: user.id  // ‚Üê CRITICAL: Must be here
  }
});
```

**Verify**:

```
> Ready! Your webhook signing secret is: whsec_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### In Another Terminal, Start Your Server

```bash
cd /Users/victorray/Desktop/vr-odds
npm start
```

### In Another Terminal, Trigger Test Event

```bash
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

### Check Logs

4. Expiry: `12/25`
5. CVC: `123`
6. Click "Pay"

### Verify in Database

```

**Should show**:
```
‚úÖ GOLD PLAN - Correctly assigned!
‚úÖ Full access to odds data
‚úÖ API requests enabled
‚úÖ Subscription valid for 31 more days

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Webhook Not Received

**Check**:
1. Is Stripe webhook endpoint registered?
   ```
   Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
   ```

2. Is URL correct?
   ```
   https://odds-backend-4e9q.onrender.com/api/billing/webhook
   ```

3. Is server running?
   ```
   Check Render dashboard
   ```

**Fix**:
- Re-register endpoint if needed
- Restart server after adding environment variables

### Problem: Webhook Received But Plan Not Updated

**Check**:
1. Are logs showing errors?
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/combined.log | grep -i "webhook\|error"
   ```

2. Is userId in metadata?
   ```javascript
   // Should have: metadata: { userId: user.id }
   ```

3. Is Supabase connected?
   ```bash
   echo $SUPABASE_URL
   echo $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
   ```

**Fix**:
- Check frontend code for metadata
- Verify Supabase environment variables
- Manually fix if needed:
  ```bash
  node server/fix-subscriber-plan.js <userId> gold
  ```

### Problem: Signature Verification Failed

**Check**:
1. Is webhook secret correct?
   ```
   Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Your Endpoint ‚Üí Signing Secret
   ```

2. Does it match `.env`?
   ```bash
   grep STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET /Users/victorray/Desktop/vr-odds/.env
   ```

**Fix**:
- Copy correct secret from Stripe
- Update `.env` file
- Restart server
