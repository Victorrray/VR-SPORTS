# Comprehensive Player Props Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Sportsbook Selector Issue**: The sportsbook selector for player props was reverting to only showing 4 books instead of all available books.

2. **No Games Returned**: Player props weren't showing any games even though `ENABLE_PLAYER_PROPS_V2` was set to `true`.

3. **Date Filter Limitation**: The date filter was restricting which games were shown for player props.

## Client-Side Fixes

### 1. Fixed Sportsbook Selector

We modified several functions to ensure the player props mode always shows ALL available sportsbooks:

```javascript
// Always use empty array for player props books to show ALL books
const [draftSelectedPlayerPropsBooks, setDraftSelectedPlayerPropsBooks] = useState([]);
```

```javascript
// Always use empty array for player props books to show ALL books
const defaultPlayerPropsSportsbooks = [];
```

```javascript
// Always use empty array for player props books to show ALL books
const newPlayerPropsBooks = [];
```

This ensures that the sportsbook selector for player props consistently shows all available books by using an empty array, which the `effectiveSelectedBooks` function interprets as "show all books".

### 2. Modified Date Filter for Player Props

We updated the date filter logic to always show all games for player props mode, regardless of the selected date:

```javascript
// If no date filter is selected OR we're in player props mode, return all games
// This ensures player props always show all available games regardless of date
if (!selectedDate || selectedDate === "" || isPlayerPropsMode) {
  console.log('üóìÔ∏è No date filter or player props mode - showing all games:', marketGames.length);
  return marketGames;
}
```

This change ensures that player props will show all available games, even if a specific date is selected.

## Server-Side Recommendations

We've documented the necessary server-side changes in `SERVER_PLAYER_PROPS_FIX.md`, which includes:

1. **Adding a Fallback for Empty Games List**: If no games are found in the regular API call, fetch games specifically for player props.

2. **Increasing Timeouts and Limits**: Update the timeout and limits constants to allow more markets and books per request with longer timeout.

## Technical Details

### Client-Side Implementation

1. **Empty Array Strategy**: We're using the empty array strategy for player props sportsbooks, which the `effectiveSelectedBooks` function interprets as "show all books".

2. **Date Filter Bypass**: We've added a special case for player props mode in the date filter logic to always show all games.

3. **Consistent Implementation**: We've updated all relevant functions (`useState`, `resetAllFilters`, `applyFilters`) to ensure consistent behavior.

### Server-Side Recommendations

1. **Fallback Mechanism**: The recommended server-side changes include a fallback mechanism to fetch games specifically for player props if none are found in the regular API call.

2. **Performance Optimization**: Increasing timeouts and limits will help prevent timeouts and ensure more comprehensive data.

## Benefits

1. **Complete Sportsbook Selection**: Users can now see and select from all available sportsbooks in player props mode.

2. **More Games Available**: By bypassing the date filter for player props, users will see all available games.

3. **Better User Experience**: These changes provide a more consistent and comprehensive experience when using player props.

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Server-Side Changes**: Follow the instructions in `SERVER_PLAYER_PROPS_FIX.md` to apply the necessary server-side changes.

2. **Test the Changes**: After applying all changes, test the player props functionality to ensure it's working as expected.

3. **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on API usage and performance to ensure the changes don't negatively impact the system.
