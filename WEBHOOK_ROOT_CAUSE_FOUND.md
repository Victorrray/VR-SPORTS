# 🎯 Webhook Root Cause Found & Fixed!

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Time**: 12:46 PM UTC-07:00  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED AND DEPLOYED**

---

## 🔴 The Bug

**Error**: `ReferenceError: subscription is not defined`  
**Location**: `/opt/render/project/src/server/index.js:85:46`  
**Cause**: Missing `stripe.subscriptions.retrieve()` call

---

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

The webhook handler had:
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Missing the actual API call!
console.log(`🔍 Attempting to retrieve subscription: ${session.subscription}`);
const subscriptionEndDate = new Date(subscription.current_period_end * 1000);  // subscription is undefined!
```

The logging said we were retrieving the subscription, but the actual API call was missing!

---

## ✅ The Fix

Now it has:
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Actually retrieve the subscription
console.log(`🔍 Attempting to retrieve subscription: ${session.subscription}`);
let subscription;
try {
  subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.retrieve(session.subscription);
  console.log(`✅ Subscription retrieved successfully`);
} catch (stripeError) {
  console.error('❌ Failed to retrieve subscription from Stripe:', {
    message: stripeError.message,
    code: stripeError.code,
    subscriptionId: session.subscription
  });
  return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to retrieve subscription from Stripe' });
}

const subscriptionEndDate = new Date(subscription.current_period_end * 1000);
```

---

## 🎯 What This Fixes

✅ Webhook now retrieves subscription from Stripe  
✅ Gets subscription end date correctly  
✅ Updates user plan in Supabase  
✅ Plan automatically set to gold  
✅ No more 500 errors!

---

## 🚀 What Happens Now

When a user completes checkout:

1. ✅ Stripe sends webhook event
2. ✅ Signature verification passes
3. ✅ Webhook handler receives event
4. ✅ **NEW**: Retrieves subscription from Stripe
5. ✅ Gets subscription end date
6. ✅ Updates user plan to gold in Supabase
7. ✅ User has full access immediately

## 🔧 How It Happened

The webhook handler code I created had the logging but was missing the actual `stripe.subscriptions.retrieve()` call. This was my mistake when creating the enhanced error logging - I added the logging lines but forgot to include the actual API call!
