# Player Props Sportsbooks Fix

## Problem Fixed

We've expanded the list of sportsbooks available in Player Props mode. Previously, the platform was filtering out many sportsbooks when in Player Props mode, showing only a limited set that were confirmed to support player props data according to The Odds API documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Expanded Player Props Bookmakers List

We significantly expanded the `playerPropsBookmakers` array in `SportsbookMarkets.js` to include:

- All major US sportsbooks (previously included)
- All DFS apps (previously included)
- Additional US books that may support player props (expanded)
- International books that might have player props (newly added)
- Additional books to ensure all user selections are included (newly added)
- Many other sportsbook keys that might be in user selections (newly added)

The list has grown from about 25 sportsbooks to over 50 sportsbooks, ensuring that virtually all user-selected sportsbooks will be shown in Player Props mode.

### 2. Enhanced Debug Logging

Added improved debug logging that shows:
- Total available sportsbooks
- Number of sportsbooks supported for player props
- Number of sportsbooks filtered out
- List of supported sportsbooks
- **List of any filtered out sportsbooks with their names**

This will help identify any remaining sportsbooks that might still be filtered out.

## Technical Details

The filtering system was originally implemented to improve user experience by only showing sportsbooks that actually provide player props data. However, this was too restrictive and prevented users from seeing all their selected sportsbooks.

Our solution maintains the filtering architecture but expands the whitelist to include virtually all sportsbooks, ensuring users can see all their preferred books in Player Props mode.

## Expected Results

- All your selected sportsbooks should now appear in Player Props mode
- The platform will attempt to fetch player props data from all these sportsbooks
- Some sportsbooks may not return player props data, but they will at least be visible in the interface
- The debug logs will show if any sportsbooks are still being filtered out

## Note

If you find any sportsbooks still missing from Player Props mode, please check the console logs to see if they're in the `filteredOutBooks` list. If so, we can add those specific sportsbooks to the `playerPropsBookmakers` array.
